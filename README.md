# Om

_is a mantra, or vibration, that is traditionally chanted_

## What it is

Magical tool that helps you configure and deploy tiles to an Ops-Manager. 
Currently being developed by RelEng, backlog link is [here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/2982497).

## Design Goals

- less flakey / faster replacement of [opsmgr](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/opsmgr)
- single binary that can be run on multiple platforms
- fully tested, not using tests to to execute browser behavior
- no capybara
- [small sharp tool](https://brandur.org/small-sharp-tools)
- idempotency for all commands

## Original design spec

please note, this can and will change from the final readme below
